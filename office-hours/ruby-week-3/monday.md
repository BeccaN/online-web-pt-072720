# NOTES FROM OFFICE HOURS - RUBY WEEK 3, MONDAY

## QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

* I see a study group on the Cohort Calendar for Ruby office hours, but not showing up on my Study Group dashboard on learn.co. Why is there a difference?
    _Learn.co will usually have all study groups and weekly lessons, but the cohort calendar is the best place to go to see the source of truth for schedules!_
* When do we start building the first project?
    _If you look on the Cohort Calendar, after Ruby Week 6, the following weeks you will see CLI Project Week 1 and CLI Project Week 2. These are your designated project build weeks. More can be found out about the portfolio project on the [project page](https://learn.co/tracks/online-software-engineering-structured/object-oriented-ruby/section-17-final-projects/cli-data-gem-portfolio-project)
* REGEX!
    * What is it?
        _Regex, or Regular Expressions, in Ruby are basically pattern recognition systems. They allow you to search a string based on a certain set of conditions, and identify what parts of that string meet those conditions._

    * Regex lab - 5 words long method
        ```ruby
        # To solve this method, we used Rubular, along with the array passed in by the test, to test different regex characters until we found the exact pattern that met the requirements.
        # Look into the word boundary character!
        ```
    * Regex lab - validating phone numbers - using the OR expression
        ```ruby
        # Can you solve this method without a bunch of if/else statements?
        # YES! Look into the OR (|) character
        ```
