# NOTES FROM OFFICE HOURS - MONDAY

# QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

# 1. I see a study group on the Cohort Calendar for Ruby office hours, but not showing up on my Study Group dashboard on learn.co. Why is there a difference?
    # Learn.co will usually have all study groups and weekly lessons, but the cohort calendar is the best place to go to see the source of truth for schedules!
# 2. When do we start building the first project?

2. some admin question I forget
3. Regex lab - 5 words long method
4. Regex lab - validating phone numbers - using the OR expression
